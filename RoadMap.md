## 🧩 2️⃣ What You Need to Learn (Step-by-Step)

I’ll give you a **structured roadmap** — like a curriculum for self-study.

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1–2)**

Understand how markets work:

- What is trading? How does a trade execute?
    
- Order types: market, limit, stop-loss, take-profit
    
- Leverage and margin (and why to avoid them early)
    
- Asset types: stocks, forex, crypto, commodities
    
- Timeframes: 1m, 5m, 1h, 4h, daily, weekly
    

📚 **Learn from:**

- **Support & resistance** (key price levels)
    
- **Trendlines & channels**

- **Indicators**: RSI, MACD, volume, Bollinger Bands
    

🧠 Goal: Learn to identify _trend direction_ and _good entry/exit zones_.

📚 Tools:

- Books: _“Technical Analysis for Dummies”_ or _“Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques” (Steve Nison)_

### **Phase 3: Risk & Money Management (Weeks 7–9)**

This is what separates **traders from gamblers**.

Learn:

- Position sizing (risk 1–2% of account per trade)
    
- Setting stop-loss and take-profit properly
    
- Risk/reward ratio (aim ≥ 1:2)
    
- Avoid overtrading
    
- Understand drawdowns
    

Practice:

- Create a spreadsheet or use a trading journal app (like _TraderSync_ or _Notion template_)
    
- Record every trade, your reasoning, and outcome.
    

---

### **Phase 4: Strategy Development (Weeks 10–16)**

Start combining tools into a **repeatable strategy**.

Examples:

- **Trend-following:** trade with the moving averages
    
- **Breakout strategy:** enter when price breaks resistance
    
- **Reversal trading:** use RSI divergence or candlestick signals
    

Steps:

1. Backtest your strategy on past data
    
2. Try it on a demo account for 1–2 months
    
3. Adjust rules until it’s consistent
    
4. Only then use your small real account (your 2k EGP)
    

---

### **Phase 5: Psychology & Discipline (Ongoing)**

This is the _hardest part_ — controlling emotions.

Study:

- Trading psychology (fear, greed, overconfidence)
    
- Build habits: patience, discipline, rule-following
    
- Never chase losses or revenge-trade
    

Recommended reading:

- 📘 _“Trading in the Zone”_ by Mark Douglas
    
- 📗 _“The Psychology of Money”_ by Morgan Housel (for general mindset)
    

---

### **Phase 6: Real Practice (After 3–6 months)**

- Start with your **2k EGP** account (or even demo first)
    
- Keep a trading journal
    
- Focus on **process**, not profit
    
- Review results weekly
    

When you can show 3–6 months of consistent small profits (even 1–3% monthly), **consider adding more capital** gradually.

You’re in a perfect position — as a software developer, you already think in systems, data, and logic — **the same mindset successful traders use**.

Would you like me to create a **weekly learning plan (like a study schedule)** with free resources and practice tasks (e.g., what to learn and do each week for the first 3 months)?  
That would make your progress much clearer and structured.
